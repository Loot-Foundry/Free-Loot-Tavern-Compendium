If a creature uses its action to examine the area the cloak is in, the creature can spot the hidden carnivorous item with a successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check. If a creature enters the space occupied by the cloak, it must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking [[/r 2d10+8]] piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p> <p><strong><em>Take-out.</em></strong> When a creature enters a space within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction to have the cloak pounce and wrap around the creature.
