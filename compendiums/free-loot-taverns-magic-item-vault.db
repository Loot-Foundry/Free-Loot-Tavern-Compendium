If you miss on the attack you may use your reaction to flare your wings and pull out of the dive. Make a Dexterity (Acrobatics)&nbsp;check. The DC for this check starts at 0 and increases by 2 for each 10 ft. descended before the attack. On a success you swoop back up to half your previous altitude. On a failure you crash, taking [[/r 1d6]] damage per 20 ft. descended.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"160\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Base items.</span></span>\n<p>This item variant can be applied to the following base items:</p>\n<div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\">&nbsp;</div>\n<ul class=\"rd__list\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">@Compendium[dnd5e.items.SK2HATQ4abKUlV8i]{Breastplate} (@Compendium[world.loot-tavern-variant-compendium.lKsQi4G82rCzWHTL]{Shadowstalker Breastplate})</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">@Compendium[dnd5e.items.p2zChy24ZJdVqMSH]{Chain Shirt} (@Compendium[world.loot-tavern-variant-compendium.WUAlGPpRhnDBYOEk]{Shadowstalker Chain Shirt})</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">@Compendium[dnd5e.items.vsgmACFYINloIdPm]{Half Plate Armor} (@Compendium[world.loot-tavern-variant-compendium.O3ZIjtWZSqPhLdin]{Shadowstalker Half Plate Armor})</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">@Compendium[dnd5e.items.n1V07puo0RQxPGuF]{Hide Armor} (@Compendium[world.loot-tavern-variant-compendium.rZQiYKWvydgSUniF]{Shadowstalker Hide Armor})</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">@Compendium[dnd5e.items.WwdpHLXGX5r8uZu5]{Leather Armor} (@Compendium[world.loot-tavern-variant-compendium.tcInA1h7wVgHqAah]{Shadowstalker Leather Armor})</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">@Compendium[dnd5e.items.GtKV1b5uqFQqpEni]{Padded Armor} (@Compendium[world.loot-tavern-variant-compendium.9Sy15ejUK95KnQFG]{Shadowstalker Padded Armor})</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">@Compendium[dnd5e.items.XmnlF5fgIO3tg6TG]{Scale Mail} (@Compendium[world.loot-tavern-variant-compendium.SVDGYv9zBMdiWbLo]{Shadowstalker Scale Mail})</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">@Compendium[dnd5e.items.TIV3B1vbrVHIhQAm]{Studded Leather Armor} (@Compendium[world.loot-tavern-variant-compendium.FXA0wmdeHD2VBUzw]{Shadowstalker Studded Leather Armor})</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"LT","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":null,"attuned":true,"equipped":true,"rarity":"Rare","identified":true,"damage":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"modules/free-loot-tavern-compendium/artwork/Shadowstalker_Garb.webp","effects":[]}
